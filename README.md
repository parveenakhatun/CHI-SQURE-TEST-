# CHI-SQURE-TEST-
A chi-squared test (symbolically represented as χ2) is basically a data analysis on the basis of observations of a random set of variables. Usually, it is a comparison of two statistical data sets. This test was introduced by Karl Pearson in 1900 for categorical data analysis and distribution. So it was mentioned as Pearson’s chi-squared test.
The chi-square test is used to estimate how likely the observations that are made would be, by considering the assumption of the null hypothesis as true.
A hypothesis is a consideration that a given condition or statement might be true, which we can test afterwards. Chi-squared tests are usually created from a sum of squared falsities or errors over the sample variance.
Chi-Square Distribution :- When we consider, the null speculation is true, the sampling distribution of the test statistic is called as chi-squared distribution. The chi-squared test helps to determine whether there is a notable difference between the normal frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more classes or categories. It gives the probability of independent variables.
Note: Chi-squared test is applicable only for categorical data, such as men and women falling under the categories of Gender, Age, Height, etc.
Finding P-Value
P stands for probability here. To calculate the p-value, the chi-square test is used in statistics. The different values of p indicates the different hypothesis interpretation, are given below:-
 P≤ 0.05; Hypothesis rejected
 P>.05; Hypothesis Accepted
 Formula:-
 χ2 = ∑(Oi – Ei)2/Ei
 where Oi is the observed value and Ei is the expected value.
